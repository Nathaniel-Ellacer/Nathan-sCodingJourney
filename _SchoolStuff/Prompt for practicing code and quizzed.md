# Code exercise (SCHOOL):
Find (questions, structuring, structured condition, )

Hello, I want you to follow the subject, coverage and prompt mentioned below:
    FORMULA
    Topics:
    Coverages: (Specific topic within topic)
    
    Conditions (Specs): (difficulty level, specificity, problem solving, edge cases) (for analytical stuff, division of quiz for future prompts (part 2 of quiz))


    Number of Items: 20-30
    
    Test/quiz style: (multiple choices (with various types... ex.: odd ones out, sentence form choices), identification, sequencing events, theory, true or false, coding exercise)


    Provide answer keys to the very bottom

    Link Feed data(optional): 

1. Hello, I want you to follow the subject, coverage and prompt mentioned below:

Pseudo programming : (coverage: flowcharts, simulation and expected output (me who makes it) and arithmetics in java, and especially PROBLEM SOLVING regarding the last coverages mentioned with some edge cases) (recursive way, linear way, loop way)


Make a 15-20 items quiz in multiple choice and put the answer key to the last (after all the question items)


Or other way around where I get to code and have the desired result/output (only provide fewer items)

2. Document and Summarize everything about all the pre existing context of the quizzes you have made with an emphasis to the edge cases being considered with simple examples 

along with dissecting its logic of each nature according to the quizzes being made previously in a bullet form

Consider more edge cases


# CODE exercises (PERSONAL):
    
A. MAKE me a coding exercise about _(topic/ subject/ prog concept/ application making)_ 

B. Design a [language] program that (does a specific tasks) 
{OPTIONAL: tackles a specific topic in programming}

    Sample Input/Output (demo):


## Expanding projects (CalcApp, AreaShapeCalc, TriviaQuiz, SchoolOrgSys)

Is there any way to expand this into or make a by stating tips _additional features_

5. Make a sample code about __specific item, topic, keyword__ and determine its purpose



5.  make an automated git commenter (cuz i forgot that thing always)
